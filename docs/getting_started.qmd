title: Getting Started
---

We make use of [Numpy arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) and [Pillow Images](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) to represent data.
Both are extremely rich tools, and to learn more about them please see the appropriate documentation for information about saving data to image files and more. 

## Installation

ImageryClient can be installed with pip:

`pip install imageryclient`

While not required, if you are using a CAVE-hosted dataset, installing [CAVEclient](https://caveclient.readthedocs.io/) will make your life much easier.

## Troubleshooting

If you have installation issues due to Cloudvolume, which can have a complex set of requirements, we recommend looking at its github [issues page](https://github.com/seung-lab/cloud-volume/issues) for help.

## Basic example

A small example that uses all of the major components of ImageryClient: Downloading aligned images and segmentation, specifying specific segmentations to visualize, and generating an image overlay.
This uses the pubically available [Kasthuri et al. 2014 dataset]({{< var urls.kasthuri >}}).

```python
import imageryclient as ic

img_src = 'precomputed://gs://neuroglancer-public-data/kasthuri2011/image_color_corrected'
seg_src = 'precomputed://gs://neuroglancer-public-data/kasthuri2011/ground_truth'

img_client = ic.ImageryClient(image_source=img_src, segmentation_source=seg_src)

bounds = [
    [5119, 8477, 1201],
    [5519, 8877, 1202]
]
root_ids = [2282, 4845]

image, segs = img_client.image_and_segmentation_cutout(bounds,
                                                       split_segmentations=True,
                                                       root_ids=root_ids)


ic.composite_overlay(segs, imagery=image)
```
