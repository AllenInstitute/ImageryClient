# Function Reference
This site provides basic documentation for the functions in `ImageryClient`.
Please see the [tutorials](../tutorials/index.qmd) for more information about how to use them.

Documentation is split into three parts:

* `ImageryClient` for using the ImageryClient class to download images and segmentation.
* `Compositing` for generating segmentation overlays for visualization.
* `Utilities` has additional utilities that may be useful for data manipulation.
    Note that, unlike the other two categories, these functions are not imported by default.
